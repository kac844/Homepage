Tuesday September 17 2019

Started Project on sweater 

Test run on sewing 
Mistake 1: Forgot that all the positive sides must connect 

Mistake 2: knot in string

Mistake 3: Broke string

Mistake 4: placed the lights backwards

Solution: was able to flip them as I did not do the negative side yet (Bad solution)


Positive side connected

Day 3 

Wednesday September 18 2019

Task: Sew negative side and put in battery and try out project 

Mistake 1: the circuits did not light up. Did not sew correctly
Solution: restart the project

Mistake 2: place lights crookedly . Uneven spacing. Sewing is uneven

Issues: the ends of the positive and negative wires kept touching.
Solution: tape down ends. Need to find something more permanent 

Number of times I pricked my finger with the needle and did not bleed: 8
Number of times I pricked my finger with the needle and did bleed: 0


Conclusion
The project ended up not lighting up but I plan to resew the project to see if my sewing is the problem. I should be more careful in how I sew and not rush to do the sewing also.
