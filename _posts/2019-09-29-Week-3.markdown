Day 6 September 29 2019
 Tried to upload code to Lily Tiny with Arduino IDE.
 Problem:

 avrdude: Yikes!  Invalid device signature.
         Double check connections and try again, or use -F to override
         this check.
 
		An error occurred while uploading the sketch


 Emailed Professor Klukowska about the problem.
