# Day ?: Monday, October 28, 2019
* For phase 2 of this project I was inspired by these two Arduino projects:

* Links here: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Jalal_Mansoori/morse-code-communication-using-arduino-f339c0 and https://www.instructables.com/id/Morse-code-with-arduinoLED/

* My project stems from the fact that during the winter it is often very dark by the time I come home and have to walk.  So I wanted to create some sort of lights that I could place on  some dog clothing so I could have some sort of light to see where I was walking.

* I decided to use the lights to send out a message in Morse code because why not. I manage to write some code that blinks out my dogs name but the code is really long and inefficient if I want to write a longer message. So today, I began rewriting my code for my project. 


## Result:
* Number of times I pricked my finger with the needle and did not bleed: 0

* Number of times I pricked my finger with the needle and did bleed: 0




# Day ?: Tuesday, October 29 2019

* I finish writing my code. I decided to use a second battery for the light that would just stay on and have nothing happen to them as there a limit on the amount of lights I can change the code to with the Arduino Lily Tiny. Tomorrow I am going to assemble everything. 

## Result:
* Number of times I pricked my finger with the needle and did not bleed: 0

* Number of times I pricked my finger with the needle and did bleed: 0

* There were several issues with sewing on the lights on the chosen piece of clothing.
	* Only one of the lights turned on so I decided to resew the other two lights.

* After resewing the second light, by the looks of it, the light was fried.
* I ran out of thread so I could not sew the third light to see if it even worked. 

* By the looks of it, I am going to have to resew the entire project and switch out the broken lights. 

## Result:
* Number of times I pricked my finger with the needle and did not bleed: 4

* Number of times I pricked my finger with the needle and did bleed: 1
