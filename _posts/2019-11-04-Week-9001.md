* I began redoing my project. To make sure I was not making the same mistakes I did the first time, I decided to plan out the project a little more. I began to sketch out a basic sketch of how I was going to sew with the thread to connect everything. This took me a while as I was trying to figure out how to connect everything without crossing wires and just make a terrible mess with my sewing.


* Here is an image of my first sketch: (very basic and not complete):

* Here is an image of my second sketch (more detailed and complete):

* After the sketch, I decided I should secure the lights and other parts to the bandana with normal thread so that I do not waste the other thread and make a huge mess with the hot glue as I did before.
 
* I am also testing different ways to remove the hot glue from the bandana so that I can have a more clean slate to work with. I am trying to get as much of the hot glue off the bandana but I do not expect to all come off.  

* I learned that it's best not to use hot glue on any type of clothing if your planning on making changes to said clothing in the future.



## Result:

* Number of times I pricked my finger with the needle and did not bleed: 0

* Today, I am going to see if my bandana idea is going to work on my test subject.

* Here is my test subject (Sol):

* I want to make sure she feels comfortable in the bandana.

* From by observation, she didnâ€™t care about it being on her so then I tried to seeing if she wants or can move in the bandana.

* By the looks of it, she can move freely in the bandana so the bandana idea will work. I plan on sketching the sketch actually on the bandana today so then by the weekend all I have to do is sew on the design.
