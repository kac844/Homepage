* Today, I began sewing on my design. First, I outline my design on the bandana. This proved to be very helpful in keeping my sewing more neat and the wires not crossing each other. 

* After outlining my design, I secure everything first with normal thread which helped keep me from overusing the conductive thread. 

* I connected the negative side  and then the positive side of the first light, which worked correctly. I decided to continue the project the next day as I felt that things were going well.

## Result:

* Number of times I pricked my finger with the needle and did not bleed: 0

* Number of times I pricked my finger with the needle and did bleed: 0

* On this day, I connected the positive side of the second and third lights and they refuse to turn on. Since they refuse to turn on, I decided to resew them. I undid the second and third light but on resew the second light as a test. I resew the light and it refuses to turn on again. I thought the issue was the lights but before starting the project, I checked the lights to make sure they worked and were not fried and they worked fine. So, I started to look into my past mistakes with the project related to wiring issues, but I really could not find a definite mistake that led to this issue.

* I could not figure out why the second and third lights were not turning on. But then I thought back to the hot glue mess that was still stuck on my project. I believe the hot glue is messing with the connection between the wires as the first light hits no hot glue patch and works fine.  This led me to try to work around the hot glue with wiring the second and third lights. I still hit some patches of hot glue because of the position of the lights were in and turned on a little but were very weak. I think I need to reposition the entire project and see if the hot glue is even the main problem.
